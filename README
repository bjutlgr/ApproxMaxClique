This project implements a Genetic Algorithm for approximating Max Clique

To execute the project on DIMACS `.clq' instances, create a directory 

	$ mkdir DIMACS_cliques

and store the clique instances that you would like to test.

The clique instances can be downloaded from:
	http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/txn131/clique.html
or
	ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/challenge/graph/benchmarks/clique/

Some instances are in binary format `*.clq.b', 
	and may require the bin2asc utility to convert to `*.clq'.  This utility can be downloaded from:

	http://cs.hbg.psu.edu/txn131/file_instances/converter.tar.gz

------------------------------------------------------------

The files required to build the algorithm implementation are:

	dimacsClq.h				--- defines graph structure, and input DIMACS `.clq' input
	dimacsClq.cpp
	setOperations.h			--- defines set operations for std::vector<uint64_t>
	setOperations.cpp
	gaClique.cpp			--- implementation of the heuristic and main invocation of GA

------------------------------------------------------------

The Perl script `buildGA.pl' is written to build the executable, and invoke the tests 

Run this file from the command line with
	
	$ perl buildGA.pl
	
It will execute the test for all `*.clq' contained within the directory `DIMACS_cliques'
